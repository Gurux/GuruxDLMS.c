Gurux.DLMS library is a high-performance ANSI C library that helps you to read you DLMS/COSEM compatible electricity, gas or water meters. We have try to make component so easy to use that you do not need understand protocol at all.
For more info check out [Gurux.DLMS](http://www.gurux.fi/index.php?q=Gurux.DLMS "Gurux.DLMS").
We are updating documentation on Gurux web page. 

Read should read [DLMS/COSEM FAQ](https://www.gurux.org/index.php?q=DLMSCOSEMFAQ) first to get started. Read Instructions for making your own [meter reading application](https://www.gurux.org/index.php?q=DLMSIntro) or build own 
DLMS/COSEM [meter/simulator/proxy](https://www.gurux.fi/Gurux.DLMS.Server).

If you have problems you can ask your questions in Gurux [Forum](http://www.gurux.org/forum).

Before start you need to copy src and include folders from development folder here.

Because you can't give compiler parameters for Arduino IDE, it's recommended that you un-comment not needed functionality from gitignore.h.
It makes schets smaller and compiler time is faster.
You also need uncomment DLMS_IGNORE_MALLOC if you want to make the server application.
